If you'd like to help contribute to the development of Primeval, message me on Discord about any suggestions or feature requests.
You can add me (24Chrome#1098) and shoot over a DM!

Everything here is still very WIP, so I don't have anything more to say about contributing. As the project gets bigger, I'll likely revamp these contribution instructions, and make things more strict.

Thanks for reading!
