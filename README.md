# Primeval

Primeval, for the Minecraft Fabric Modloader is an interpretation of mods like TerraFirmaCraft, aiming for a complete overhaul of Minecraft systems to create a rustic, realistic game progression. You are dropped into a natural setting rich with materials and life, but punching a tree is no longer an option. 

Start in the stone age and work your way up through many anchient and medieval technologies and processes, constructing your own medieval world.
